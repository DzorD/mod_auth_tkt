Test Instructions
=================

1. To run the test suite against the currently configured apache version:

   make test
   # (see the Makefile for details, but it's basically just running ./TEST)



2. To run a single unit test e.g. 01_basic.t:

   ./TEST 01_basic.t


3. To run a single unit test through gdb (seems to have to be done from
   the top-level directory):

   # (make sure you've run with './configure --debug' for debug symbols)
   t/TEST -one-process -debug=gdb -breakpoint=tkt_digest t/01_basic.t
